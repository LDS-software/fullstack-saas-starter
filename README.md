### 📂 **Monorepo Architecture & Setup**

This project is a **High-Performance Monorepo** orchestrated by **Turborepo** and managed by **pnpm**. This setup ensures efficient dependency sharing, fast builds via remote caching, and a clean separation between the **BFF (NestJS)** and **Frontend (Next.js)**.

## 🚀 Deployment & Infrastructure

This project follows professional software engineering standards, utilizing a multi-environment strategy to ensure high availability and continuous delivery.

### 🧪 Staging Environment (HML)
The staging environment is hosted on **Render**.
> **Note:** Since it uses Render's free tier, the services may experience a **"Cold Start"** (30-50 seconds delay) if they haven't been accessed recently. Once awake, performance is stable.

* **Frontend:** [web-staging-sbjp.onrender.com](https://web-staging-sbjp.onrender.com)
* **BFF (Backend for Frontend):** [bff-staging.onrender.com](https://bff-staging.onrender.com)
* **Core API:** [saas-business-manager.onrender.com](https://saas-business-manager.onrender.com)

### 🏗️ Tech Stack & DevOps
* **Database:** Utilizing **Neon.tech**, a serverless PostgreSQL with autoscaling capabilities and point-in-time recovery.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Fully automated via **GitHub Actions**. Every push to the `main` or `develop` branch triggers automated builds, linting, and deployment.
* **Infrastructure Strategy:** I've implemented a separation of concerns between the API, BFF, and Web layers, all orchestrated within a **Turborepo** monorepo for maximum performance during development and deployment.

---

#### **Prerequisites**
* **Node.js**: v18 or higher.
* **pnpm**: v9.0.0 or higher.
  > If not installed, run: `sudo corepack enable`

---

#### **1. Initial Installation**
From the root directory, install all dependencies for every application and package within the workspace:
```bash
pnpm install
```

#### **2. Environment Configuration**
Navigate to the BFF directory to set up your environment variables (required for **Prisma ORM**):
```bash
cd apps/bff
cp .env.example .env
```

#### **3. Running in Development**
To launch the entire ecosystem (BFF + Frontend) simultaneously with a single command:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
> **Note:** Turborepo will handle parallel execution and provide a unified log stream for both services.

### 🛠 **Tech Stack**
* **Monorepo Manager**: [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/)
* **Package Manager**: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (Content-addressable storage)
* **Backend (BFF)**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) + [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)
* **ORM**: [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
* **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

---

### **Why this setup?**
* **Scalability:** The `pnpm-workspace.yaml` structure allows us to scale to dozens of microservices without duplicating `node_modules`.
* **Reliability:** By using `packageManager` enforcement, we ensure all developers and CI/CD pipelines use the exact same environment.
* **Speed:** Turbo's caching mechanism significantly reduces build times for international-level production deployments.
